Cyclic Vacuum Cannon
====================
First it steals.. Then it jettisons.

The Cyclic Vacuum Cannon is a curiosity that I've been wanting to build for a while. Its a whimsical fantasy engine/gun that steals objects from elsewhere in the universe then spits them out to propel itself forward or blast its enemies. 

You can find out more about the Cyclic Vacuum Cannon at its [Presstube Project Page](http://presstube.com/cyclic-vacuum-cannon "Cyclic Vacuum Cannon at Presstube").

##Episodes##

###Episode 1: Brainstorming ([Watch Screencast](https://vimeo.com/48454761 "CVC - Brainstorming on Vimeo"))###
In this episode I break a concept drawing of the Cyclic Vacuum Cannon into its constituent parts, take a first crack at naming them, and think out loud about their responsibilities & relationships. Starting a project this way helps me get a better understanding of what I'm in for, and to decide where to start building.

###Episode 2: Setup###
[Watch Screencast](https://vimeo.com/48454761 "CVC - Brainstorming on Vimeo")
In this episode I do the setup dirty work that's necessary before I can get to the fun stuff: 
- create an open source repo at GitHub, 
- briefly introduce my choice of tools, 
- and craft a workspace / workflow that I can use as I move forward.

###Coming up...###
In episode 3 I'll fiiinally get down to the fun part: rolling up my sleeves and starting to build the cannon itself.

##About Presstube Code Journal##
I love watching people work. It's one of my favorite ways to learn. In case there's anyone out there who feels the same way I've decided to start a code journal where I step through the creation of a Presstube project from the pre-code brainstorming phase, all the way through to launching it in its finished state, and everything in-between. 

I'll release each journal entry as a short, 10-15min, screencast. Each entry will correspond to a branch in this repo so you can follow along, and/or take the project in a direction I never would have thought of.

I have three different groups of people in mind while making this journal:
1. Like-minded coders who might find it interesting to peer over my shoulder as I work.
2. Those who are a lot better at all this stuff than I am who might be able to point me in the right direction about how to improve, and/or chuckle at my ineptitude.
3. People who may never have coded before but are curious about it and want to see what it's all about in the context of a fun, silly, highly visual project.
