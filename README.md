#Cyclic Vacuum Cannon#
First it steals.. Then it jettisons.

The Cyclic Vacuum Cannon is a contraption that steals objects from elsewhere in the universe then spits them out to propel itself forward and/or blast enemies. It's a concept from my sketchbook that I've been wanting to bring to life for a while, and chose it as the inaugural project for my [Code Journal](#about-presstube-code-journal "About Presstube Code Journal").

<!-- You can find out more about the Cyclic Vacuum Cannon at [its other home at Presstube](http://presstube.com/cyclic-vacuum-cannon "Cyclic Vacuum Cannon at Presstube"). -->

##Episode 0: Brainstorming → [Watch Screencast](https://vimeo.com/48454761 "Watch Episode 0: Brainstorming on Vimeo")##
In this episode I break a concept drawing of the cannon into its constituent parts, take a first crack at naming them, and think out loud about their responsibilities & relationships. Starting a project this way helps me get a better understanding of what I'm in for, and decide where to start building.

##Episode 1: Setup → [Watch Screencast](https://vimeo.com/50235100 "Watch Episode 1: Setup on Vimeo")##
In this episode I do the setup dirty work that's necessary before we can get to the fun stuff: 

- Create an open source repo here at GitHub 
- Briefly introduce my choice of tools 
- Put together a workspace & workflow to use as we move forward.

##Coming up next...##
In episode 3 we'll fiiiinally get down to the fun part: rolling up our sleeves and starting to build the cannon itself.

##About Presstube Code Journal##
I love watching people work. It's one of my favorite ways to learn. In case there's anyone out there who feels the same way I've decided to start a code journal where I step through the creation of projects from their pre-code planning phase, all the way through to their finished form.

I plan to release each journal entry as a short, 10-15 minute  screencast. Each entry will correspond to a branch in their GitHub repo so you can follow along, and/or take the project in your own direction.

I have several kinds of people in mind while making this journal:

1. Like-minded coders who might find it interesting to peer over someone else's shoulder while they work.
2. Those who are a lot better at this stuff than I am who might get a chuckle out of my backwards ways and/or point me in the right direction about how to improve. (suggestions and critique will be incorporated into future entries)
3. People who are new to code but are curious about it, and might like to peek into the world of programming via a fun, silly, highly visual project.
