Cyclic Vacuum Cannon
====================
First it steals.. Then it jettisons.

##Intro##
This first project in my code journal will be a curiosity that I've been interested in trying to build for a while: The Cyclic Vacuum Cannon. Its a whimsical fantasy engine/gun that steals objects from around the universe then spits them out to propel itself forward or blast its enemies. 

You can find out more about the Cyclic Vacuum Cannon at its [Presstube Project Page](http://presstube.com/cyclic-vacuum-cannon "Cyclic Vacuum Cannon at Presstube").

##Episodes##

###Episode 1: Brainstorming###

In this first screencast I break a concept drawing of the Cyclic Vacuum Cannon into its constituent parts, take a first crack at naming them, and think out loud about their responsibilities & relationships. Starting a project this way helps me get a better understanding of what I'm in for, and to decide where to start building.

###Episode 2: Setup###

In this episode I do the setup dirty work necessary before we can get to the really fun stuff. I'll Set up an open source repo at GitHub, briefly introduce my choice of tools, and craft a workspace / workflow that I can use as I move forward.

###Coming up in Episode 3###
In episode 3 we'll get down to the fun part. We'll roll up our sleeves and start actually building the cannon.

##About Presstube Code Journal##
I love watching people work. It's one of my favorite ways to learn. In case anyone out there feels the same way I've decided to start a code journal where I'll step through the creation of a Presstube project from the pre-code brainstorming phase, all the way through to launching it on the web. I'll release each journal entry as a short, 10-15min, screencast. Each entry will correspond to a branch on the project's open source GitHub repo so you can follow along, make this project your own, and/or take it in a direction I would never have thought of.
